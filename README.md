This is the code repository for [Test-Driven Development in Go](https://www.packtpub.com/product/test-driven-development-in-go/9781803247878), published by Packt.

**A practical guide to writing idiomatic and efficient Go tests through real-world examples**

## What is this book about?

Experienced developers understand the importance of designing a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure efficient shipping and maintaining services in production. This book shows you how to utilize test-driven development (TDD), a widely adopted industry practice, for testing your Go apps at different levels. Youâ€™ll also explore challenges faced in testing concurrent code, and learn how to leverage generics and write fuzz tests.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Create practical Go unit tests using mocks and assertions with Testify
* Build table-driven test suites for HTTP web applications
* Write BDD-style tests using the Ginkgo testing framework
* Use the Godog testing framework to reliably test web applications
* Verify microservices architecture using Pact contract testing
* Develop tests that cover edge cases using property testing and fuzzing
